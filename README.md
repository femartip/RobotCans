# Robot Cans 

Solution to simple robot cans problem in the most efficient way. The objective is that the robot throws all the cans in the bins with the least number of movements. This is solved in "robot_latas.clp".
There is also two more extensions of this problem;
1. "robot_latas_id.clp" In this problem, every can and bin has its own id. To throw a can to a bin, this id needs to be the same.
2. "latasytaller.clp" Here the robot has a battery, every movement consumes some battery, if the robot is low of battery, it will need to go to a charging station to charge its battery.

This is done using the programming language CLIPS. This is a rule based programming language. More info in https://www.clipsrules.net/
